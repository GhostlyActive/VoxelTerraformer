# VoxelTerraformer

VoxelTerraformer is an experimental voxel world project written in C#, focused on chunk-based terrain, real-time terraforming, and clean, extensible architecture.  
The project serves as a foundation for exploring voxel rendering, block interaction, and scalable world systems using raylib.

The goal of VoxelTerraformer is not to be a full game, but a flexible sandbox and technical playground for experimenting with voxel engine concepts.
